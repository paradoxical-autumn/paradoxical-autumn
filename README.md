<p align="center">a programmer with a passion for trying out cool new stuff and fixing things that should've been fixed ages back</p>
</p>
I'm someone who is interested in coding for fun and making scripts to make life easier. I've been coding in Python for about 6 years but I'm also strong in Lua, which I've been coding in for about 3 years now. I'm also studying game design officially to continue my journey in that field even though I only specialise in UIs and programming.

## ðŸ”­ currently working on:
- random stuff
- fixing stuff \*
- stupid stuff

\* If I randomly fork your repo, it's probably because I use it often enough that I wanted to fix at least one issue in it.

## ðŸŒ± currently learning:
- C#

## ðŸ§  I want to learn:
- Javascript
- Rust
- HTML
