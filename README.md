<h1 align="center">Hiii, I'm Autumn 👋</h1>
<p align="center">a programmer with a passion for trying out cool new stuff and fixing things that should've been fixed ages back</p>
</p>
I'm someone who is interested in coding for fun and making scripts to make life easier. I've been coding in Python for about 5 years but I'm also strong in Lua, which I've been coding in for about 2 years now (but still learning). I've also tried my hand at game making and so I also have skills in that field (design, music production, UI/UX design). 

## 🔭 currently working on:
- random stuff
- fixing stuff
- stupid stuff

## 🌱 currently learning:
- Lua (decent)

## 🧠 I want to learn:
- Javascript
- Rust
- C#
- HTML

## ⚡ Fun fact:
- I literally cannot code without music on.
